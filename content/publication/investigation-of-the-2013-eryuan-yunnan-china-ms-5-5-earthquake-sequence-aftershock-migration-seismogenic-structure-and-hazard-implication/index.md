abstract: "The Chuan-Dian block is one of the most seismically active regions in
  China. However, its western boundary – Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault is an
  exception, which had maintained nearly 65-year hiatus in major seismic
  activity until 2013. Recently, several moderate earthquakes (MS 5.0– 6.4) have
  successively occurred near the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault, attracting
  attention from the public. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis
  for the 2013 MS 5.5 Eryuan earthquake sequence that occurred ~20 km southwest
  of the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault. We integrate a machine-learning-based
  earthquake detection and location workflow and a template matching technique
  to derive 749 high-precision earthquakes directly from continuous streams of
  raw seismic data. These aftershocks started from NE of the mainshock, then
  bilaterally expanded towards SE and NW directions, and eventually activated a
  SE-trending complex fault structure with ~18 km length. We also use a
  waveform-based inversion algorithm to calculate the focal mechanisms of the
  mainshock and its relatively large aftershocks, resulting in four
  predominantly normal-faulting events and seven strike-slip events, which
  further illuminate the 2013 Eryuan sequence was accommodated by a strike-slip
  fault system separated by extensional stepover zones. In addition, we identify
  six repeating earthquake doublets in the aftershock sequence, implying that
  some aftershocks of the MS 5.5 Eryuan mainshock may be driven by afterslip.  "
