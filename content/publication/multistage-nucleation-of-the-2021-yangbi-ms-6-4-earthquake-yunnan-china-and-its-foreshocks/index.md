abstract: On 21 May 2021, an MS 6.4 earthquake occurred in Yangbi, Yunnan
  province, China. A significant foreshock sequence occurred 3 days before the
  mainshock, which provides an opportunity to study earthquake nucleation. In
  this study, we adopt a template matching technique and a double-difference
  location method to build a catalog for the foreshock sequence of the 2021
  Yangbi MS 6.4 earthquake, which contains 1,086 events with high-precision
  locations. The whole foreshock sequence can be grouped into four episodes,
  each with one MW > 3.7 principal foreshock. The foreshocks within the first
  episode initiated on a NW-trending small fault, whereas the subsequent
  foreshocks within episodes 2–4 jumped onto a nearby major fault to gradually
  rupture toward NW direction. We identify three MW > 3.4 repeating earthquakes
  on the NW-trending small fault in episode 1, implying that aseismic slip
  occurred in the early stage of the mainshock nucleation. Meanwhile, the
  rupture dimension estimation and stress disturbance analysis of the later
  foreshocks in episodes 2–4 reveal a cascading rupture process on the major
  fault, indicating that stress transfer may dominate the later stage of the
  mainshock nucleation. Hence, our study suggests that the two end-member
  mechanisms of aseismic slip and stress transfer may be compossible in the
  nucleation process of the 2021 Yangbi MS 6.4 mainshock.
